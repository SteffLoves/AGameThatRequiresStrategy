# AGameThatRequiresStrategy
Assignment for project 1 in CS2

"We are going to play a fun strategy game that only requires two 
players! In this game, we have an 8 x 8 board and a Knight chess piece that starts on the top left
of the board. Each player gets to move the Knight piece one square over either down, diagonal,
or to the right of its current position (a player cannot move the piece two or more squares). The
Knight piece can keep moving until it reaches the bottom right corner of the board. The
respective player that moves the Knight to the bottom right corner of the board wins the game! In
this assignment you are going to implement the winning strategy for both players."
